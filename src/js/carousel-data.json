You can have a message from your CEO to open the training, video testimonials from some of your employees, interviews with your subject matter experts or dramatised scenarios using actors. You can film in a studio, on location or in virtual worlds (using green or blue screen)."

      "description": "Game mechanics in learning motivate achievement by satisfying psychological needs. We build in performance indicators that measure how well learners doing as they answer questions, complete tasks or make decisions. This flags up weaker areas early on and spurs them on when they’re on a roll."
